## What is *Anglers*?
*Anglers* across Colorado now have the ability to view current fishing conditions including weather and river flow as well as leave tips for fellow anglers.

### How does it work?
*Anglers* aggregates river conditions by accessing current USGS (United States Geological Survey) river station data. Combined with fishing reports with local insight from the finishing community, *Anglers* is a valuable resource for your next day on the water.
